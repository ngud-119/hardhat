# Sample Hardhat Project

This project demonstrates a basic Hardhat use case. It comes with a sample contract, a test for that contract, and a script that deploys that contract.

Try running some of the following tasks:


npx hardhat help

<h1>Testing contracts</h1>
  <p>npx hardhat test</p>
  <p>REPORT_GAS=true npx hardhat test</p>
<h1>Deploying your contracts</h1>
  <p>npx hardhat node </p>
  <p>npx hardhat run scripts/deploy.ts</p>
  <p>You can deploy in local with hardhat: This is command <h3>npx hardhat run --network localhost scripts/deploy.ts</h3></p>
<h1>Verifying your contracts</h1>
 <p>You can get Sepolia eth</p>
 <p>https://sepoliafaucet.com/</p>
 <p>To be fair to all developers, You only get 0.5 Sepolia ETH every 24 hours.<p>
